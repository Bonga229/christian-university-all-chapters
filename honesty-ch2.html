      <h1>Chapter 2: Honesty in Relationships</h1>

      <p>In nature, everything is connected — rivers to oceans, roots to trees, air to breath. Connection is survival. But for humans, connection often becomes the very place where trust is broken.</p>

      <p>Why do friends turn into enemies? Why do sons and daughters grow distant from their parents? It’s rarely because of distance. It’s because somewhere along the way, honesty disappeared — with them, and with ourselves.</p>

      <blockquote>The first lie you ever told wasn’t to someone else. It was to yourself.</blockquote>

      <p>You said “I’m fine” when you weren’t. That small lie became a mask. The mask became a personality. And the personality became a prison.</p>

      <h2>My Second Year Story</h2>
      <p>In my second year of university, I had found my people. Three of us, doing everything together — eating, laughing, even failing tests side by side. We were stupid in the best way. But somewhere along the way, something changed.</p>

      <p>We were all goofy, but they could stay goofy in front of anyone. I couldn’t. That part of me — the loud, hyper side — was something I’d started hating back in high school. I thought it made people take me less seriously, like I wasn’t worth listening to. I carried that into uni, pretending I didn’t care… but the truth was, it ate at me.</p>

      <p>Being around them brought that side of me out again. Some people would call it ADHD. All I knew was: I wanted to change. I thought, “If I stay friends with them, I’ll never grow up.” Maybe that was true. Maybe it wasn’t. But I made my decision.</p>

      <p>I didn’t tell them the real reason. Instead, I lied — said my parents didn’t want me doing this or that. Slowly, I ignored their calls, skipped meetups, acted busy. In my head, I was protecting myself. But really, I was just avoiding an uncomfortable conversation.</p>

      <p>It ended badly. I lost two of the closest friends I’d ever had. Not because we disagreed. Not because we grew apart. But because I wasn’t honest from the start. I became the bad guy in my own story.</p>

      <h2>What Could Have Happened</h2>
      <p>If I had told them the truth — that I was struggling with who I was, that I wanted to work on myself — maybe they wouldn’t have understood at first. Maybe they would’ve been hurt. But at least they would’ve known. At least trust would still be there.</p>

      <p>That’s the thing about honesty: it doesn’t guarantee people will stay. But it guarantees that if they leave, they leave knowing the real you — not the fake one you made to avoid conflict.</p>

      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
      <p>We tell ourselves we’re protecting others by keeping quiet, but deep down, we’re protecting ourselves from rejection. Silence is not love. Lies are not kindness.</p>

      <p>In Christian University, we choose to speak truth — with kindness, with love, but without fear. Because without honesty, there can be no real connection.</p>
