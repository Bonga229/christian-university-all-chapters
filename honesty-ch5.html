    <h2>Honesty – Chapter 5: Desires</h2>

    <p>My first year of university was when my eyes opened to a new world. I remember stepping into the residence for the first time—it was so beautiful that I honestly thought they had made a mistake. Me? A walk-in student? I expected them to knock on my door any day and say, “Sorry, you don’t belong here.”</p>

    <p>Every night I’d stand by the window in disbelief. I had never been a dreamer before, but something changed in that room. For the first time, I wanted more. I wanted to live like that every day, not just for a year. And that was when my dreams were born. But with dreams comes the question: <em>how?</em></p>

    <p>My roommate at the time had started trading forex. We had all heard stories—that forex is where the money is, where young people turn into millionaires overnight. Of course, I joined him. I had a dream to chase. But along the way I got slapped so hard, by reality. Forex was nothing like what I expected. It was brutally hard. Those who made money either sold courses, poured in years of effort, or just got lucky. None of those paths were mine.</p>

    <p>So I switched. I heard about a guy in residence who made money dropshipping. I jumped in, believing maybe this was it. But dropshipping wasn’t easy either. The barrier to entry was low, which meant competition was everywhere. The grind was real. And I didn’t last.</p>

    <p>I noticed something though. As I started watching youtube for answers, all the young millionaires I watched on YouTube had one thing in common. YouTube itself. So I tried that too. I kept chasing, chasing, chasing. Forex, dropshipping, YouTube, and many other things I could name. I could go on for days. But the truth is this: I never stuck with one long enough. Sometimes I told myself it was because “this is not for me.” Other times I wondered if I had just given up too early.</p>

    <p>The world is full of influences. And it will always be that way. You will always see someone doing something amazing, and for a moment you’ll feel like maybe that’s your path too. The danger is that you might chase so many of these influences that you forget your own voice. And sometimes it gets so bad that you start believing you were <em>meant</em> for the thing you were influenced into. Until one day, you wake up miserable, empty, realizing it never came from you.</p>

    <p>That’s why honesty matters here too. Because the only way to know what you really desire is to strip away the noise. Forget what the world says. Forget what is trending. Forget what other people claim is “the way.” Be honest with yourself: what actually feels like you? What doesn’t feel like a mask, or a costume you’re wearing just to impress others? What desire keeps coming back, even when you try to bury it?</p>

    <p>Looking back, I realize that out of all the things I’ve tried, one thing still feels alive to me—this project, Christian University. I don’t know how far it will go, but I know what it feels like inside. It feels like mine. It feels like something that heals me, and one day maybe it will heal others too, this is my dream, for us to be released from the traumas that were rubbed off on us, to escape from the slavery of this world, to understand that only one thing can set you free, and it is not money, it is truth. That’s the kind of desire I want to chase. Not the ones fed to me by ads or influencers, but the ones that whisper inside when the world is quiet.</p>

    <p>We all have a purpose. Some people find it early, others stumble for years. But it’s not hidden out there—it’s buried inside you. And the only way to uncover it is through honesty. Be honest about why you want what you want. Be honest about what feels empty versus what feels real. Because once you know, even if it’s small, even if it’s fragile, you’ll have something worth building your life around.</p>
